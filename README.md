# Wang Lab - Virus-Immune System Coevolution

Welcome to the Wang Lab GitHub Pages site! This repository contains the source code for our lab's website, showcasing our research in virus-immune system coevolution through the integration of experimental biology and artificial intelligence.

## Lab Mission

Our lab focuses on understanding and predicting the dynamic coevolution between viruses and immune systems by bridging experimental biology with artificial intelligence. We pioneer high-throughput methods, AI-driven research, and adaptive feedback loops to tackle emerging viral threats.

## Research Directions

### 1. High-Throughput Methods & Robotic Automation
- mRNA Display Technology
- Yeast Display Systems  
- Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS)
- Automated Laboratory Workflows

### 2. AI for Science
- **AI Researcher**: Automated question generation, literature review, and paper writing
- **AI Bioinformatics**: AI agents for data cleaning, analysis, and interpretation
- **AI Reproduction**: GitHub-mode reproduction through AI agents
- **AI Modeling**: Virus evolution and antibody foundation models

### 3. Lab-Feedback AI Loop
- Real-time prediction updates
- Adaptive learning systems
- Threat response automation
- Continuous model refinement

## Website Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional design with smooth animations
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Performance**: Fast loading with optimized assets
